        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <div class="box">
        <p>Founded in 2002, the Institut Universitaire des Grandes Ecoles des Tropiques (IUGET) emerged as a response to Cameroonâ€™s growing demand for quality higher education aligned with international standards and local development needs. <br>Established in Douala, the economic capital of Cameroon, IUGET was born out of a vision to bridge the gap between academic theory and practical industry skills.
            
            From its inception, IUGET placed a strong emphasis on technology, engineering, business, <br>and applied sciences, quickly gaining recognition as one of the leading private universities in the region. Its mission: to equip students with the tools necessary to thrive in a competitive global workforce while contributing meaningfully <br>to national progress.
            
            Over the years, IUGET has grown from a modest academic institution to a comprehensive university with several faculties, modern laboratories, international partnerships,<br> and a diverse student body. With a commitment to innovation, excellence, and entrepreneurship, the university continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the next generation <br>
             of leaders in Cameroon and beyond.
            
            Today, IUGET stands as a proud symbol of academic resilience, producing graduates who are both intellectually prepared and socially responsible.

    <h2>A word from the Principal
    </h2>
    <p>The option taken by Cameroon to reach the emergence at the horizon 2035, finds in this context a resonance bringing great hopes in terms of employment and career opportunities. <br>We are convinced that, despite the unemployment rate that strongly affects the young population, the future remains promising if they receive adequate training. <br>In order to respond to this imperative, which will serve as a gateway to quality employment, IUGET opens its doors to offers training that meets the needs of the job market,<br> particularly through its specialized engineering cycle. Our university institute offers a truly professional training, <br>through a permanent immersion in the practice and reality of the business world.</p>
